## Code Examples

This code example shows an html route used for displaying information on a single book.

```js
router.get("/book/:id", withAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const bookData = await Book.findByPk(req.params.id, {
    include: [
      {
        model: Review,
        include: [{ model: Comment, include: Reader }, { model: Reader }],
      },
    ],
  });
  if (!bookData) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: "No book found with this id." });
  }
  const book = bookData.get({ plain: true });
  const bookFavoriteCount = await ReaderBook.count({
    where: {
      book_id: req.params.id,
    },
  });
  const bookFavoriteByReaderData = await ReaderBook.findOne({
    where: {
      reader_id: req.session.user_id,
      book_id: req.params.id,
    },
  });
  console.log(book.reviews);
  const isFavorite = bookFavoriteByReaderData ? true : false;

  res.render("book", {
    book: book,
    bookFavoriteCount: bookFavoriteCount,
    isFavorite: isFavorite,
    logged_in: req.session.LoggedIn,
  });
});
```

This code example shows an api route used to let a reader post a review for a book.

```js
router.post("/", withAuth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const reviewData = await Review.create({
      title: req.body.title,
      body: req.body.body,
      reader_id: req.session.user_id,
      book_id: req.body.id,
    });

    res.status(200).json(reviewData);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json(err);
  }
});
```

This code example is a function that was written and used in many different areas of the code base to determine logged in status and provide certain permissions based on the result.

```js
const withAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.session.LoggedIn) {
    res.redirect("/");
  } else {
    next();
  }
};

module.exports = withAuth;
```
